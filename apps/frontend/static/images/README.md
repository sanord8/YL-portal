# Logo Assets

## YoungLife Logos

Place the official YoungLife logo files in this directory:

### Required Files:
- `younglife-logo.svg` - Primary logo (SVG preferred for scalability)
- `younglife-logo-white.svg` - White version for dark backgrounds (navigation)
- `younglife-logo.png` - PNG fallback (if SVG not available)

### How to Get the Logos:
1. Visit https://www.younglife.org
2. Contact your YoungLife representative for official brand assets
3. Or download from YoungLife's internal brand resources portal

### Usage:
- Navigation bar: Uses white version (`younglife-logo-white.svg`)
- Footer: Uses standard version (`younglife-logo.svg`)
- Fallback: Currently showing "YL" badge until logo is added

### Specs:
- Recommended size: 120px width for navigation
- Format: SVG (preferred) or PNG with transparent background
- Color: YoungLife green (#90c83c) or white for navigation

Once you add the logo files here, update the `+layout.svelte` file to reference them.
