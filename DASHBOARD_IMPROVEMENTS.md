# Dashboard Improvements - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Implemented role-based dashboards with special funds support and mobile-first responsive design.

## Completed Work

### 1. Database Schema Changes
- **File**: `apps/backend/prisma/schema.prisma`
- Added `userId` field to Department model (optional, nullable)
- Added `personalDepartments` relation to User model
- Added index on `userId` for performance
- **Status**: ✅ Code complete, ⚠️ Migration pending (see below)

### 2. Backend Changes

#### Dashboard Router (`apps/backend/src/trpc/routers/dashboard.router.ts`)
- Added `getPersonalFunds` endpoint - Returns user's special funds department with balance
- Added `getOrganizationAlerts` endpoint - Admin-only alerts for pending approvals, high-value transactions, rejections
- **Status**: ✅ Complete

#### Department Router (`apps/backend/src/trpc/routers/department.router.ts`)
- Updated `list` endpoint to filter special funds departments based on access
- Admins see all departments (including all special funds)
- Regular users see only their own special funds + regular departments from assigned areas
- **Status**: ✅ Complete

### 3. Frontend Components

All components created in `apps/frontend/src/lib/components/`:

#### Mobile-Optimized Components
- **CollapsibleSection.svelte** - Expandable/collapsible section with smooth transitions
- **SwipeableCardRow.svelte** - Horizontal scrolling cards on mobile, grid on desktop
- **QuickActionBar.svelte** - Floating bottom action bar for mobile quick actions

#### Dashboard Components
- **SpecialFundsCard.svelte** - Gold-themed card for user's personal funds department
- **AdminDashboard.svelte** - Organization-wide dashboard with:
  - Alerts section (pending approvals, high-value, rejections)
  - All areas balance overview
  - Income vs Expenses trend (6 months)
  - Expenses by area (pie chart)
  - Auto-refresh every 5 minutes
  - Collapsible sections on mobile

- **UserDashboard.svelte** - Personal dashboard with:
  - Special funds card (prominently displayed at top)
  - Personal stats (income, expenses, pending, areas)
  - Swipeable area cards on mobile
  - Recent activity section
  - Simplified charts (3 months)
  - Quick action bar on mobile

#### Main Page
- **apps/frontend/src/routes/+page.svelte** - Role-based routing
  - Shows AdminDashboard for admins (`user.isAdmin === true`)
  - Shows UserDashboard for regular users
  - **Status**: ✅ Complete

## Database Migration Required

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: The database migration has NOT been applied yet due to dev server file locks.

### Option 1: Stop Server and Run Migration (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Stop the dev server (Ctrl+C in the terminal running pnpm dev)

# 2. Navigate to backend directory
cd apps/backend

# 3. Run migration
pnpm db:migrate --name add_user_id_to_departments

# 4. Go back to root and restart dev server
cd ../..
pnpm dev
```

### Option 2: Manual SQL Migration (Without Stopping Server)

Connect to your PostgreSQL database and run:

```sql
-- Add userId column to departments table
ALTER TABLE departments
ADD COLUMN user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

-- Add index for performance
CREATE INDEX departments_user_id_idx ON departments(user_id);

-- Update Prisma migration tracking (optional, keeps migrations in sync)
```

Then restart the dev server to regenerate Prisma client.

## Testing Checklist

Once migration is applied:

### 1. Admin Dashboard Testing
- [ ] Login as admin user
- [ ] Verify organization-wide metrics display
- [ ] Check alerts section shows pending approvals
- [ ] Verify all areas are visible
- [ ] Test collapsible sections on mobile
- [ ] Verify charts render correctly

### 2. Regular User Dashboard Testing
- [ ] Login as regular user
- [ ] Create a special funds department:
  ```sql
  INSERT INTO departments (id, area_id, user_id, name, code, description)
  VALUES (
    gen_random_uuid(),
    '<area_id>',  -- Replace with valid area ID
    '<user_id>',  -- Replace with test user ID
    'Personal Funds',
    'PF-USER',
    'Personal special funds for user'
  );
  ```
- [ ] Verify special funds card appears at top (gold theme)
- [ ] Check personal stats are accurate
- [ ] Test swipeable cards on mobile
- [ ] Verify quick action bar on mobile
- [ ] Ensure regular areas are still visible

### 3. Mobile Responsiveness Testing
- [ ] Test on mobile viewport (Chrome DevTools)
- [ ] Verify collapsible sections work smoothly
- [ ] Test horizontal scrolling cards
- [ ] Check quick action bar appears on mobile
- [ ] Verify layout doesn't break on small screens

### 4. Access Control Testing
- [ ] Regular user should NOT see other users' special funds
- [ ] Admin should see ALL special funds departments
- [ ] Regular user should see only their assigned areas
- [ ] Admin should see all areas

## Key Features

### Special Funds Department
- Private to individual users (only user and admins can see it)
- Distinguished by `userId` field in Department model
- Highlighted with gold theme in UI
- Appears at top of UserDashboard
- Can be used for personal expense tracking, reimbursements, etc.

### Role-Based Dashboards
- **Admin View**: Organization-wide metrics, alerts, all areas
- **User View**: Personal focus, special funds, assigned areas only
- Automatic routing based on `user.isAdmin` flag

### Mobile-First Design
- Collapsible sections to reduce clutter
- Horizontal scrolling cards for touch-friendly navigation
- Floating quick action bar for common tasks
- Responsive breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop)

## Files Modified/Created

### Backend
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Added userId field
- `src/trpc/routers/dashboard.router.ts` - New endpoints
- `src/trpc/routers/department.router.ts` - Updated filtering

### Frontend
- `src/routes/+page.svelte` - Role-based routing
- `src/lib/components/CollapsibleSection.svelte` - NEW
- `src/lib/components/SwipeableCardRow.svelte` - NEW
- `src/lib/components/QuickActionBar.svelte` - NEW
- `src/lib/components/SpecialFundsCard.svelte` - NEW
- `src/lib/components/AdminDashboard.svelte` - NEW
- `src/lib/components/UserDashboard.svelte` - NEW

## Next Steps

1. **Apply database migration** (see instructions above)
2. **Test with real data** (create test special funds departments)
3. **Verify mobile responsiveness** (use DevTools mobile viewport)
4. **Optional enhancements**:
   - Add ability to create special funds from UI (admin panel)
   - Add budget tracking to special funds
   - Add notifications for alert thresholds
   - Add more granular permissions for special funds access

## Notes

- Dev server is currently running successfully on http://localhost:3000 (backend) and http://localhost:5174 (frontend)
- Prisma client will auto-regenerate when server restarts after migration
- All code changes are backward compatible (userId is optional/nullable)
- No existing data will be affected by the migration
